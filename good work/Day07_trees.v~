(** * Binary trees *)

(** Recall the definition of binary trees [bt] from Day04_structures:

Inductive bt (X : Type) : Type :=
| empty
| node (l : bt X) (v : X) (r : bt X).

*)

Check empty.
Check @empty nat.
Check (node empty true empty). (* leaf node *)
Check (node empty 5 empty). (* leaf node *)
Check (node empty G (node empty C empty)).
Check (node (node empty 12 empty) 25 (node (node empty 5 empty) 5 empty)).

Compute (size (node (node empty 12 empty) 25 (node (node empty 5 empty) 5 empty))).

(** We defined some terminology already: a _leaf_ is a node where both
    children are [empty].

    The _root_ of a tree is the topmost node. *)

Definition root {X : Type} (t : bt X) : option X :=
  match t with
  | empty => None
  | node _ v _ => Some v
  end.

Compute (root (node (node empty 12 empty) 25 (node (node empty 5 empty) 5 empty))).
(* ===> Some 25 *)

(** It's common enough to want to make a leaf that we'll define a
    function to do it for us. *)
Definition leaf {X : Type} (v : X) : bt X := node empty v empty.

Compute (root (node (leaf 12) 25 (node (leaf 5) 5 empty))).
(* ===> Some 25 *)

(** * What are trees for? *)

(** Trees are a useful and general structure. Computer scientists use
    trees:

    - In interpreters, compilers, and program analyses to represent
      and manipulate programs.

    - In machine learning's so-called "decision trees".

    - In game AI to represent strategies.

    - In operating systems to store filesystem information.

    - In databases to quickly manipulate stored values.

    But it's not just CS! Biological systematists use trees to model
    evolutionary relationships. Linguists use trees to model syntactic
    structure. Genealogists use trees to model familial relationships.

    Trees are a Big Deal. Here's a very contrived tree model of
    declarative English sentences. *)

(** * Traversals *)

(** A tree is a useful data structure in a program, but it isn't
    always what people want to see---people often do better with
    lists.

    Any function that looks at every node of a tree is called a
    _traversal_. The word 'traversal' often refers particularly to the
    process of converting a tree to a list.

    There are three common notions of traversal, named for what they
    do with the value at a given node:

    - A _pre-order_ traversal puts the value first, then traverses the
      left child, then the right child.

    - An _in-order_ traversal first traverses the left child, then the
      value of the node, then the right child.

    - A _post-order_ traversal first traverses the left child, then
      the right child, then the value of the node.

    You'll notice that all three of these go left-to-right. That's a
    convention---you could look at the right children, then the left
    children, then the node. Which traversal you use in practice
    depends on *)

(** Here's an in-order traversal. *)
Fixpoint inorder {X : Type} (t : bt X) : list X :=
  match t with
  | empty => []
  | node l v r => inorder l ++ [v] ++ inorder r
  end.

Compute (inorder (node (node empty 12 empty) 25 (node (node empty 5 empty) 5 empty))).

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard (traversals)

    Define traversal functions [preorder] and [postorder] that
    implement those respective traversals. *)

(** * Binary search trees (BSTs) *)

(** Binary search trees are pervasive and powerful data
    structures. They are used to implement sets and associative maps,
    two of the most commonly used data structures.

    BSTs _refine_ binary trees with an _invariant_ called the 'search
    property'. A binary tree [t] is said to have the _search property_
    when for a given ordering (i.e., a notion of 'less than' and
    'greater than'):

    - [t] is [empty], or

    - [t] is [node l v r] where:

      + [l] and [r] have the search property

      + every value in [l] is less than [v]

      + every value in [r] is greater than [v]

    The search property is very useful. Suppose you have a binary
    search tree, and you wonder if a value [n] is in it. First, you
    check the root: if that's it, great. If not, then ask: is [n] less
    than or greater than the root? You only have to keep looking in
    one side of the tree! If your tree is well balanced, you'll do
    very little traversal at all.  If you kept a list rather than a
    BST, you'd have to search the whole list to be sure. Nice... what
    a savings!

    It turns out other operations on BSTs---adding and deleting
    elements---are also very efficient. We'll implement a few.

    (Sometimes people want BSTs were values in [l] are less than _or
    equal to_ [v]. It depends; for sets and maps, you want _less
    than_, because it guarantees there are no duplicates.)
*)

(** **** Exercise: 1 star, standard (search_property)

    Write two trees of naturals that have the search property and two
    trees that do not. All of your trees should have at least two
    nodes. *)

(** We've already defined [eqb] and [leb], so we could just use
    those. But it's common to use a [compare] operation that gives us
    'complete' comparison information. It saves comparisons and is
    less error prone. What's not to like? *)
Inductive ordering : Type :=
  | LT
  | EQ
  | GT.

Fixpoint compare (n m : nat) : ordering :=
  match n, m with
  | O, O => EQ
  | S _, O => GT
  | O, S _ => LT
  | S n', S m' => compare n' m'
  end.

Compute (compare 0 0).       (* ===> EQ *)
Compute (compare 0 10).      (* ===> LT *)
Compute (compare 7 4).       (* ===> GT *)
Compute (compare 1000 1000). (* ===> EQ *)

(** Here's a function that uses the search property to rapidly
    determine whether or not a value is in a BST already. *)
Fixpoint lookup (n : nat) (t : bt nat) : bool :=
  match t with
  | empty => false
  | node l v r =>
    match compare n v with
    | LT => lookup n l
    | EQ => true
    | GT => lookup n r
    end
  end.

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard (insert)

    Write a function that inserts a number [n] into a binary search
    tree [t]. To get full credit, you should use the binary search
    property!

    What should your function do when [n] is already in the tree?  *)
Fixpoint insert (n : nat) (t : bt nat) : bt nat (* REPLACE THIS LINE WITH ":= _your_definition_ ." *). Admitted.

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard (remove_min)

    Write a function that tries to remove the smallest element from a
    binary search tree. You'll need to return not just the smallest
    element, but also what's left of the tree.

    Your function should return [None] only when [t] is [empty]. Use
    the search property! *)
Fixpoint remove_min (t : bt nat) : option (nat * bt nat) (* REPLACE THIS LINE WITH ":= _your_definition_ ." *). Admitted.
(** [] *)

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, standard (remove)

    Write a function that removes a number [n] from a binary search
    tree.  If [n] isn't in the tree, you should return the tree
    unchanged.

    It turns out this is a hard function to write! Here's a general
    plan:

    - Handling [empty] should be simple.

    - To remove [n] from [node l v r], look at [compare n v].

      + The [LT] and [GT] cases should be simple.

      + The [EQ] case is tricky! Use [remove_min] to find a new root
        element from [r] if you can. What does it mean if [remove_min
        r = None]?
 *)
Fixpoint remove (n : nat) (t : bt nat) : bt nat (* REPLACE THIS LINE WITH ":= _your_definition_ ." *). Admitted.
(** [] *)

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, standard, optional (is_bst)

    Write a function [is_bst] that takes [t : bt nat] and returns
    [true] if [t] has the search property.

    There are different ways to go here. A few hints:

    - You'll need at least one helper function. How can you check the
      "every value" parts of the search property?

    - Don't think about efficiency---you're just making things hard
      for yourself. Get it to work first, and then make it efficient
      if that'll make you happy.

    We'd like you to write the signature yourself. If you can't finish
    writing the function, that's fine---but make sure you use
    [Definition] and [Admitted] to leave something behind for the
    grader. Talk to the TAs if you're stuck.  *)
